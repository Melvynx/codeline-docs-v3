description: How to report bugs and issues in courses.
---

The easiest way to report any troubles in a course is to select any text on the page :

<img src="/report-1.png" alt="Report 1" />

When you report, an email and notification will be sent to the author of the course.

<Callout title="Don't use comments !" type="warn">

The "Comments" section is useful to explain something about the lesson, not to report bugs.

</Callout>
