## How to Set Up Affiliates on Codeline

To establish your affiliate program on Codeline, begin by accessing the affiliate settings through your schoolâ€™s settings page. You can do this by visiting the following link: [Codeline Affiliate Settings](https://codeline.app/admin/affiliates). Once there, enable the affiliate feature and select the products you wish to include in the affiliate program.

After setting up, you can share your school's affiliate page with potential affiliates. The link to your affiliate page is structured as follows: `https://codeline.app/YOUR-SCHOOL-ID/affiliate`.

Affiliates can then use this link to promote your products. They can append their unique affiliate reference to any Codeline link. For instance, a checkout link would look like this: `https://codeline.app/YOUR-SCHOOL-ID/checkout/ITEM_ID?ref=AFFILIATE_ID`, and a landing page link would be: `https://codeline.app/YOUR-SCHOOL-ID/courses/ITEM_ID/courses?ref=AFFILIATE_ID`.

To further enhance tracking and ensure that all links on your site include the affiliate reference, integrate the following script into your product's landing page:

```html
<script src="https://codeline.app/affiliate-script.js"></script>
```

This script will automatically track clicks on your links and append the `?ref=AFFILIATE_ID` parameter to every link on your website, ensuring accurate tracking of affiliate referrals.
